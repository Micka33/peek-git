# Glimpse::Git

Provide a glimpse into the Git info of your Rails application.

Things this glimpse view provides:

- View the current branch name
- Compare the diff of the current revision on your GitHub repo

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'glimpse-git'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install glimpse-git

## Usage

Add the following to your `config/initializers/glimpse.rb`: 

```ruby
Glimpse.into Glimpse::Views::Git
```

You will need to set the GitHub project's name with owner if you plan on
comparing the current ref against your default branch on GitHub.

```ruby
# nwo - name with owner - owner/name
Glimpse.into Glimpse::Views::Git, :nwo => 'dewski/json_builder'
```

You can also manually set each of the following optional options:

- SHA
- Default Branch (master by default)
- Branch Name

```ruby
Glimpse.into Glimpse::Views::Git, :sha => '740f6b7b11b8717efaf51ddb98ce23394544f7e0', :default_branch => 'rails4.0', :branch_name => 'integration'
```

## Using Glimpse::Git on Heroku

If you try to deploy this to Heroku it won't actually work right away. Heroku
removes the .git directory which doesn't allow us to fetch theÂ HEAD ref or branch.

To solve this, there is a custom buildpack that is forked from the default Ruby
buildpack that will set `GIT_SHA` and `GIT_BRANCH` for you.

To install this buildpack just run:

```
heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/dewski/heroku-buildpack-ruby.git --app appname
```
